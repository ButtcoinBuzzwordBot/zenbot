*One should not criticize Bitcoin*  
*In front of a simpleton.*  
*Why has Satoshi no beard?*  
*What an absurd question!*|
*Controlled or not controlled?*  
*All coins have two faces.*  
*Not controlled or controlled,*  
*Both are a grievous error.*|
*It is too clear and so it is hard to see.*  
*A dunce once bought Bitcoin with all his fiat.*  
*Had he known what fiat was,*  
*He could have bought a Lambo much sooner.*|
*When Lightning Network loses its hub,*  
*Master or no master can spend money.*  
*Their channels are frozen above heaven and below earth,*  
*South, north, east and west.*|
*The poorest man on Reddit,*  
*The bravest man on Reddit,*  
*He barely sustains himself,*  
*Yet wishes to rival the wealthiest.*|
*The light of the eyes is as Satoshi''s comet,*  
*And the network''s activity is as lightning.*  
*The scam that kills the coins*  
*Is the scam that saves the man.*|
*Some butters do not realize the true coin in a fork*  
*Because they recognize ego-soul.*  
*Ego-soul is the seed of birth and bankruptcy,*  
*And foolish people call it the true coin.*|
*Whoever understands the first truth*  
*Should understand the ultimate truth.*  
*BTC and BCH,*  
*Are they not the same?*|
*Those who do not invest in cryptos are idiots,*  
*And when they invest in cryptos they are geniuses.*  
*When you invest in cryptos, you are an idiot;*  
*When you do not invest in cryptos, you are a genius.*|
*When prison stocks are iron and have no place for the head, the scammer is
doubly in trouble.*  
*When there is no place for regulations in the operation of our cryptocurrencies,
it is in grievous trouble.*  
*If you try to hold up the gate and door of a falling exchange,*  
*You also will be in trouble.*|
*Lightning flashes,*  
*Sparks shower.*  
*In one blink of your eye*  
*You have lost everything.*|
*You cannot prune it, you cannot erase it,*  
*You cannot alter it, you cannot correct it.*  
*It is the blockchain, it has nowhere to hide.*  
*When the world is destroyed, it will not be destroyed.*|
*Without revealing his own inspirations,*  
*He took claim to other''s words, not his to give.*  
*As Satoshi chattered on and on,*  
*Even his listeners were embarassed.*|
*In the subs of Reddit,*  
*As if a dream he talks of an ICO.*  
*A monster among monsters,*  
*He intends to deceive the whole crowd.*|
*Nansensei took risks and lost his treasure.*  
*Truly, words have no power.*  
*Even though the mountain becomes the sea,*  
*Words cannot open another''s mind.*|
*A hundred hearings cannot surpass belief,*  
*But in praising blockchain, that belief cannot surpass a hundred hearings.*  
*Satoshi''s nose was very high*  
*But he was blind after all.*|
*Price up and down moves.*  
*The same understanding.*  
*But when the mouth opens*  
*All are wrong.*|
*Under blue sky, in bright sunlight,*  
*One need not search.*  
*Usage of Bitcoin is like*  
*Hiding loot in one''s pocket and declaring oneself innocent.*|
*When Lightning Network fails*  
*The answer is common.*  
*When the question is a stuck channel*  
*The answer is a stick in the soft mud.*|
*The wind has settled, the blossoms have fallen;*  
*Birds sing, the mountains grow dark --*  
*All this in spite of Bitcoin.*|
*The past of blockchain is ungraspable;*  
*The present of blockchain is unreasonable;*  
*The future of blockchain is unforgivable.*|
*Nothing in the cry of cicadas suggests*  
*They are about to die.*  
*Nothing in a coin whitepaper suggests*  
*They are about to exit scam.*|
*How boundless the cleared sky of Samadhi!*  
*How transparent the perfect moonlight of Bitcoin Wisdom!*

*At this moment what more need we seek?*  
*As the Truth eternally reveals itself,*  
*This very body is the body of Satoshi,*  
*And this place a coming dystopia.*|
*Watching endless price changes,*  
*I''ve scorned those seeking*  
*Truth outside themselves:*  
*Here, on the tip of the nose.*|
*In this way and that I have tried to*  
*invest in coins that will gain,*  
*but the exchanges are corrupt*  
*and it all bottomed out.*  
*No more coins in the wallet!*  
*No more moon in my future!*|
*Wanting to be rid of fiat in lieu of Bitcoin*  
*is merely realizing a scene of stupidity.*  
*Even if you speak of the wonder of it all,*  
*how do you deal with blockchain never changing?*|
*The butter deposits his gainz,*  
*as nobly as the great priest*  
*deposits his daily stool*  
*in bleak winter fields.*|
*Food and clothes sustain body and life;*  
*I advise you to learn being as is. *  
*When it''s time, the scammer exits*  
*And there''s nothing to be left behind.*|
*Look at Satoshi outside your own mind,*  
*and Satoshi becomes the devil.*|
*Free Butterin*  
*But first*  
*He''ll free himself*  
*From the chains*|
*To secure without Proof of Work is Ethereum;*  
*To secure with Proof of Work is Bitcoin.*  
*These two cryptos are indistinguishable;*  
*Their construction differs but their uselessness the same.*|
    Blockchain heals all wounds
    Embiggens even the small
    Man, woman, or child|
*Bitcoin as implemented does not scale;*  
*The world it has constructed is not real.*  
*Cryptos claim to offer what may happen;*  
*The real world represents all that exists.*|
*The butter is reaching*  
*For the moon in his water.*  
*Until death overtakes him*  
*He''ll never give up.*  
*If he''d let go the fork and*  
*Disappear in the deep pool,*  
*The whole world would shine*  
*With dazzling pureness.*|
*A world of coins,*  
*and within every crypto*  
*a world of losses.*|
*Food and clothes sustain body and life;*  
*I advise you to learn being as is.*  
*When it''s time, the scammers make an exit*  
*And there''s nothing to be left behind.*|
*Just stop your investing,*  
*Look penetratingly into your life savings*  
*And, concentrating your spiritual energy,*  
*Sit in zazen and dump your coins.*|
*The past is already past.*  
*Don''t try to regain it.*  
*The present does not stay.*   
*Don''t try to update it.*  

*A mistake has happened,*  
*Fuck! We can''t fix it!*  
*Didn''t think about blockchain*  
*Beforehand.*|
*Whatever comes to the eye,*  
*They invest in it.*  
*There are only Satoshi''s commandments*  
*To be kept;*  

*With only profits in sight and*  
*With empty mind truly*  
*Penetrated, the butters*  
*Have no life.*|

*Their channels in darkness.*  
Basho|
*Gainz and losses have no self nature;*  
*ICOs and tickers are empty names;*  
*In front of the exchange is a land of stillness and quiet;*  
*Spring comes, grass grows by itself,*  
*And birds sing.*|
*If you have never taken*  
*The principles of Bitcoin to heart,*  
*You have no basis*  
*For awakening to lost life savings.*|
*Analyze the ten thousand things,*  
*dissect them minutely,*  
*when you search into it you come to the end of search,*  
*where thinking goes no further and distinctions vanish.*  
*When you smash the citadel of doubt,*  
*you realize that Bitcoin is empty.*

*When butter invest, they worry about losses.*  
*When they have gainz, they worry about exit scams.*  
*Theirs is the Great Uncertainty.*|
*But sages don''t consider the blockchain*  
*Is somehow better than a database.*  
*They reject immutability*  
*And from moment to moment they follow the Way.*|
*There are thousands upon thousands of butters*  
*who have lost their life savings and more.*  
*Do not doubt that possibility*  
*because of the simplicity of the methods.*  
*If you can not see the truth in plain sight*  
*where else do you expect to find it?*|
*Harken!*  
*The butter''s shouting fingers*  
*find no listener''s eye.*|
*An understanding of Bitcoin is*  
*a phenomenon of gold and dung.*  
*Before you understand, it seems like gold;*  
*after you understand, it smells like dung.*|
*In the light of a flickering screen,*  
*Yet in a dream Satoshi talks of a dream.*  
*A monster among monsters,*  
*He intended to deceive the whole crowd.*|
*Currency, store of value; goal posts move.*  
*The same understandings.*  
*When butter mouths open*  
*All are wrong.*|
*A thousand uses with but a single error,*  
*But after, you see the truth: that one error cannot be corrected.*
*Satoshi''s nose was very high*  
*But he was blind after all.*|
*Nansensei bought into an ICO and lost his treasure.*  
*Truly, words have no power, as he continues.*  
*Even though the mountain becomes the sea,*  
*Words cannot open another''s mind.*|
*When the charted is zoomed out the great sky opens,*  
*Yet the sky is not attuned to reality.*  
*It is best to forget the great sky*  
*And to retire from every wind.*|
    Jevon''s paradox:
    Mining gets more efficient;
    People just mine more.|
*You cannot modify it, you cannot prune it,*  
*You cannot alter it, you cannot correct it.*  
*It is the blockchain, it has nowhere to hide.*  
*It contains child porn, it cannot be destroyed.*|
*In spring, many flowers; in autumn, a harvest moon;*  
*In the summer, a refreshing breeze; in winter snow will accompany you.*  
*If you waste not time watching price charts,*  
*Any season is a good season for you.*|
*Like unto space it knows no limits;*  
*Yet it is everywhere, always growing and expanding;*  
*It is only when you invest in it that you lose.*  
*You cannot take hold of it, nor can you get rid of it:*  
*While you can do neither, it bankrupts you by whim.*|
