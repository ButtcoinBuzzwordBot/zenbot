Said Master Rojaa Veru: When a coin moves from one butter to another, that is
a transaction. What, then, is the form of one butter transacting?

A monk asked Master Karuparesu, "If I have a coin, what shall I do with it?"

Master Karuparesu replied, "Destroy it."

Regarding no-coiners, a monk once asked Master Gabin Anduresen this question:
are not no-coiners truly enlightened, since they have no attachment to a single
coin? Have they transcended even the blockchain?

Master Gabin instructed him thus: Go to the market, and purchase for me three
pounds of flax.

The monk did as instructed, and understood.

Two butters were arguing about the price of Bitcoin fluctuating on their charts.

One said, "The value moves. 1 BTC != 1 BTC."

The other said, "The chart moves. Its value stays the same."

They argued back and forth but could not agree.

Hui-neng, the sixth patriarch, wisely said: "Gentlemen! It is not the value that
moves. It is not the chart that moves. It is your belief that moves."

The two butters were struck with awe.

Satoshi said, "1 BTC = 1 BTC."

Timu Doreipa received a university professor who came to inquire about buttcoins.
Timu opened his hot wallet, and began withdrawing coins from his vistor''s exchange
account until it was empty, and then kept withdrawing.

The professor watched the error messages until he no could longer restrain himself.
"It is empty. No more will come out!"

"Like my wallet," Timu said, "you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How
can I teach you buttcoin unless you first learn to hodl?"

The professor saw and understood.

I seen you before?" The monk answered, "No sir, my account is new."

"Then go and buy Bitcoin," said Maruku.

He saw another monk. "Have I ever seen you here before?" he asked. "Yes sir, of course
you have," said the second monk. "Then go and buy Bitcoin," said Maruku.

Later, the manager of the exchange asked Maruku, "How is it that you tell the same
thing whatever the reply to your question?" At this Maruku shouted, "Manager, do you
have an account?" "Of course," replied the manager.

"Then go and buy Bitcoin," said Maruku.

As if the clouds retreated to reveal the sun, the manager understood.

A student of butters was told to read a whitepaper and invest in a new altcoin.
He was much upset, because he felt that this investment would interrupt his gainz
for many months. So he said to his friend, the advanced student Andoreasu Antonurosu:

"Please read the whitepaper for me. There are so many things I do not know; but if
you do we can discuss it and in this way I can learn as I invest."

"I will read the whitepaper," said Antonurosu, "but let me ask you: If you are hungry,
what satisfaction to you if I eat rice? If your feet are lame, what comfort to you if
I walk merrily? If your bladder is full, what relief to you if I piss?"

The student heard this admonition and felt as if he had tasted sweet nectar.

A buttcoin master asked one of his monks, "Can you get fiat out of Tethers?"

"I''ll try," said the monk, and he cupped his hands in the air. The master said,
"That''s not very good. You haven''t got anything in there!"

"Please, master," said the monk, "show me a better way."

Thereupon the master seized the monk''s neckbeard and gave it a great yank. "Ouch!"
yelled the monk. "You hurt me!"

"That is the way to get value from Tethers!" replied the master, as the monk returned
to his basement.

Chari Shuremu was the fifth Bitcoin patriarch. One day he announced that he was off to
jail and his successor would be he who showed deepest insight into the new paradigm.
The chief monk took brush and ink and wrote on the temple wall:

"The chain is a Merkle tree, the coin a store of value.
Bound together by Proof of Work, the price can only rise."

No other monk dared compete with the chief monk. But at twilight a lowly disciple who
had been working in the kitchen snuck into the temple and wrote:

"The blockchain is not chain nor block nor tree, a coin must be currency.
Great expenditures of energy do not instill value."

Later that night Chari Shuremu call the disciple and said, "I have read your insight
and chosen you as my successor, please take my private keys. Be warned the chief monk
will be jealous of you and may do you harm. You must leave the monastery tonight."

Before the break of dawn the chief monk learned the news. He called his minions,
who grabbed automatic weapons and pursued the disciple. Wheezing and panting,
they overtook him just a stone''s throw away from the temple, where he was setting
up a node. "Give me the private keys!", the chief monk cried.

The disciple opened his hand and showed the chief monk his Nano Ledger. 

Daylight broke as the chief monk realized he was defeated. The mob returned to the
temple and set it on fire.

Master Kureigu found two groups of monks, from the Bitcoin sub and the Bitcoin Cash
sub, squabbling over the ownership of a bitcoin. He took the bitcoin, waved it in the
air over his head, and said to the quarrelers:

"Show me a good altcoin if you want to save it!" No one said a word. Master Kureigu
went to an exchange and turned the bitcoin into tether, giving one half to each group.

That night when /u/Chrysatrice returned to the monastery, Kureigu told him the story.
/u/Chrysatrice said nothing; but he took off his sandals, balanced them on his head,
and walked away.

Kureigu said aloud, "/u/Chrysatrice could have saved the cat."

Master Rojaa said, "There is." The monk asked, "Can you tell me what it is?"

Master Rojaa said, "It is not Bitcoin. It is not copies. It is not smart contracts.
It is not altcoins. It is learning to think."

The smile on the monk''s face lit up the night as he understood.
