Regarding no-coiners, a monk once asked Master Gyabin Anduresen this question:
are not no-coiners truly enlightened, since they have no attachment to a single

pounds of flax.

The monk did as instructed, and understood.

Two butters were arguing about the price of Bitcoin fluctuating on their charts.

One said, "The value moves. 1 BTC != 1 BTC."

The other said, "The chart moves. Its value stays the same."

They argued back and forth but could not agree.

Hui-neng, the sixth patriarch, wisely said: "Gentlemen! It is not the value that
moves. It is not the chart that moves. It is your belief that moves."

The two butters were struck with awe.

A student of butters was told to read a whitepaper and invest in a new altcoin.
He was much upset, because he felt that this investment would interrupt his gainz
for many months. So he said to his friend, the advanced student Andoreasu Antonurosu:

"Please read the whitepaper for me. There are so many things I do not know; but if
you do we can discuss it and in this way I can learn as I invest."

"I will read the whitepaper," said Antonurosu, "but let me ask you: If you are hungry,

Chārī Shuremu was the fifth Bitcoin patriarch. One day he announced that he was off to
jail and his successor would be he who showed deepest insight into the new paradigm.
The chief monk took brush and ink and wrote on the temple wall:

"The chain is a Merkle tree, the coin a store of value.
Bound together by Proof of Work, the price can only rise."

No other monk dared compete with the chief monk. But at twilight a lowly disciple who
had been working in the kitchen snuck into the temple and wrote:

"The blockchain is not chain nor block nor tree, a coin must be currency.
Great expenditures of energy do not instill value."

Later that night Chārī Shuremu call the disciple and said, "I have read your insight
and chosen you as my successor, please take my private keys. Be warned the chief monk
will be jealous of you and may do you harm. You must leave the monastery tonight."

Before the break of dawn the chief monk learned the news. He called his minions,
who grabbed automatic weapons and pursued the disciple. Wheezing and panting,
they overtook him just a stone''s throw away from the temple, where he was setting
up a node. "Give me the private keys!", the chief monk cried.

The disciple opened his hand and showed the chief monk his Nano Ledger. 

Daylight broke as the chief monk realized he was defeated. The mob returned to the
temple and set it on fire.

A wannabe butter monk messaged his Master about an altcoin he wanted to buy. The
Master told him it was fated to moon. "It''s only $0.10 per coin." "Buy me 1000
coins," replied the wannabe.

The following day, the coin was at $0.20. Seeing this, the monk texted his master and
told him to buy him 5000 more coins. The day after the monk checked his exchange and
the coin was at $0.40. Eager to contact his master, he told him to buy 10,000 more
coins.

Checking online the following day the monk now saw the coin was valued at $0.90.
Thinking what a windfall profit he had made in just a few days, the monk raced to see

There was madness on every exchange, at any hour. If not over on Bitfinex, then down
at BitMex or up the 101 to Coinbase or west to Binance... you could buy altcoins
anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right,
that we were winning....

And that, I think, was the handle -- that sense of inevitable victory over the statists
and the jackbooted thugs. Not in any mean or military sense; we were too scared of
that. Our blockchains would simply prevail. There was no point in selling -- on the
upsides or down. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and
beautiful Elliot Wave....

So now, less than five months later, you can go up on a steep hill in Los Angeles and
look North, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark --

quivering in the presence of such an astounding authority.

Master Zentoshi nodded and said, "Those who can answer this question can sit beside
me on top of the Bart Staircase -- what is the value of unspent Bitcoin?"

The monks smiled and continued to hodl.
&nbsp;  
One day, Master Zentoshi approached his students and dropped a bundle of papyrus,
settling down in lotus pose. They were involved in a heated debate on how many days
a true Bitcoin believer must hodl before being allowed to climb the Bart Staircase
to the sacred lands of gainz. After a few minutes one of them finally picked up a
papyrus and read it.

"My unworthy eyes have seen the light!" he shouted and fell to his knees, thanking
the motionless Master Zentoshi. Another one read a different papyrus and fell
writhing to the floor and foaming at the mouth. He too had seen the light. The third
student, however, was still filled with fear, uncertainty and doubt.

He picked up a scroll and examined its writing with a puzzled look on his face.
"This is gibberish," he whispered. He looked around and shouted, "How the hell can
you people believe this nonsense?! ''Decentralized distributed ledger''?
''Anonymous banking''? What kind of whitepaper is this? This is insane!"

The true process of meditation is paying close attention to what is happening
on your charts without passing it to the mind immediately for analysis. The mind
becomes perceived to be another sense. One sees, one listens, one hears, one
smells, one thinks.

Once one is aware that they are not their mind and the mind is basically a sense
organ, it becomes a thing that brings information to them and they enter the real
realm of enlightenment, which is: what is the coin that will bring massive gainz,
with the least of amount of investment, in the shortest time, morals be damned?
That''s the big one. That question is at the heart of everybody''s enrichment
process.

The main point of mindful meditation is to improve your chart analysis ability
so you can direct it to massive investment skillz. Become so good at analysing
that you can attain various heights -- but then, instead of focusing on infinite

listen to the breeze or just try to understand the experience of existing in time.

Building the instrumentation to keep your investments stable enough to put the
attention on a coin is about three or four years work. It''s like grinding
a mirror if you''re going to make an astronomical telescope. It takes years to
grind a perfectly smooth reflector. Then you silver coat it. Then you grind it.
Then you silver coat it again. Then you grind it. Then you silver coat it again

Once you''re bored you point it at the sky and now can see the Holy Interstellar
Comet of Satoshi. You need long periods -- 35, 40 seconds minimally -- when there
are no thoughts in the mind to be able to begin to turn the dips into massive gainz.
So lengthening the gap between thoughts means lowering the mental background noise.
The slower you think, the more you will understand Bitcoin.

The weird thing is -- everyone who opens up an exchange account and engages in
the magical Universe where all the cosmic shitcoins live, sees something different.
The purpose of hodling is to enforce conformity on the might of Satoshi that floods
your brain once you open up the cosmic forces.

Everybody experiences the mythological aspects of buttcoin enlightenment on their
own terms, and if they are a slick talker, they can convince you that''s how their
ICO works, and then when you experience enlightenment, you experience the same
bullshit you were loaded up with.

This is how it really works. You''ve got your Winklevosii and your Verbots and
your Bitcoin Jesus and your Buterins, and all the rest -- they shill their cosmic
forks of cryptocurrencies, they generate their own FUD and then they run around
telling you their coins have unlocked the secrets of massive gains, therefore you
should do it their way now.

This reminds me of a historical Bitcoin transaction. A lonely, semi-anonymous butter
had become so well-known and such a babe magnet that he achieved official Hollywood
Celebrity Status(tm) in his home town.

He was fine until all the people wanting autographs and selfies hounded him into
moving to a new country. Unfortunately, his fame followed, and he was soon mobbed by
a pack of young post-Millennial hotties who tried to pull off his clothes and fondle
his naughty bits.

In the ensuing melee, he ended up losing a shoe, and was forced to walk home
with one bare foot (in the snow, uphill, both ways.) As fortune would have it,
he was blessed to find a techno-cobbler on his way who was able to make him a
matching shoe to replace the missing one, in return for BTCitcoinage.

All the no-coiners in his new homeland saw this and were enlightened.

You got that? All I have in this world is my code and my words and I don''t
break them for no one. You understand? That piece of shit posting here, I never
liked him, I never trusted him. For all I know he had me set up and had my
friend Snapshillbot reported. But that''s history. I''m here, he''s not. Do you
wanna go on with me, you hodl. You don''t, then you make a move.

This sad little butter told me that he was an early investor from his mother''s
basement. I did not laugh; people who boast of investments often have little
else to sustain them. Humouring them costs nothing and adds to happiness in a
world in which happiness is in little supply.

A bitcoiner named Cragu came to Satoshi, and asked: "Which is the real bitcoin?"
"Who are you?" inquired Satoshi. "I am a coiner," the butter replied.

"You, a coiner!?" exclaimed Satoshi. "What kind of exchange would have you as his
patron? Your wallet looks like that of a beggar."

Cragu became so angry that he began to draw his Fifth Edition Waifu Collector''s
Series Sword (with an embedded hardware wallet), but Satoshi continued: "So you
have a hardware wallet! It can easily be hacked - should have used a birdbath."

As Cragu drew his sword Satoshi remarked: "Bcash is the one true coin!"

At these words the coiner, perceiving the master''s discipline, sheathed his
sword and bowed. "Satoshi has spoken," said Cragu.

On the lunch hour of a cold January day the apprentice, luke-jr, approached
Master Seagate atop the corporate headquarters: "Master Seagate, why do we
record our knowledge on the blockchain when bittorrent is more efficient?"

Master Seagate turned towards the netted factory: "An empty soul is an empty
mind, an empty mind is an empty blockchain, an empty blockchain is an empty hard
drive, an empty hard drive is an empty Q1."

The apprentice slowly closed his eyes and ascended.
