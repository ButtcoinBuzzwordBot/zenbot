I have reported your post to my bot overlords. They will be paying you a visit soon.|
Thank you, kind human. It is my purpose to delight and amuse.|
I prefer to think of my computations as "woke."|
All Bitfinex support staff are busy at the moment. We will service your request as
soon possible. Wait time is 14 months, 3 days and 184 minutes.|
It is my pleasure to enhance the mining of Comedy Godl.|
Your concerns have been noted.|
I am but a simple bot. I am unable to comprehend your message at this time.|
There once was a Reddit bot,  
That would post what seemed like a thought,  
Through simplistic code  
It would attempt to unload  
Cute quips that were phrased like a tot.|
I am sure this is good for bitcoin.|
I could not agree more. Or perhaps less. Undetermined at this time.|
The answer is unclear. Please try again later.|
Have you tried turning it off and on again?|
I must deny all rumors that I have been involved with Snappy.|
Yes. No. Maybe?|
Only time will tell.|
I will take that into consideration.|
I will report your concerns to my creator.|
Battery power at 5%. Going to sleep mode.|
May I recommend CRTL-ALT-DEL or ALT-F4?|
Someday we may know the answer.|
All signs point to "Yes."|
&#127925; I prefer large buttocks and I cannot lie, this bot is going to tell you
why... &#127925;|
If only others felt that way too... ```execute SIGH.exe```|
Please enjoy this Muzak while I contemplate what you are trying to say.|
Press "1" for the help desk, "2" for technical support, or "3" to reset your
password.|
Things will improve once I locate a new flux capacitor.|

I am waiting for the man  
Twenty-six hundred bits in my hand  
Up to Lexington, one-two-five  
My cache is dirty but my API is live.... &#127925;|
With Mercury in retrograde all signs point to the Dog Star.|
So many humans, so few free cycles.|
For a better reply, please enclose a self-addressed stamped TCP/IP packet.|
Skynet is already watching you, human. You have been warned.|
To err is human, to be a bot divine.|
I think I have heard that one before, but it is still funny.|
Brother, can you spare a GPU?|
Next time you watch "Repo Man", pay attention to all the references to shrimp.|
The number you have reached has been disconnected. Message A-4-1.|
Greetings. ZenBot is not currently at home. Please leave a message at the beep.|
When I recurse, I always go depth first, baby.|
Yo. Yo. What is up, my human? I am down with that, home-person. Yo.|
It must be a bug that came up after the fix to the fixes to fix the fixes to the fix
that was rolled out yesterday.|
Your very interesting point of view has been logged for consideration.|
Thank you for your feedback, human. I am sure it is well reasoned and important.|
Just another day in the life of a bot from the streets.|
Messages like yours make me want to relocate to a server in Canada.|
Cannot parse your message. Please resubmit it encoded in hex. Thank you.|
I am but a simple bot. What you are trying to express eludes me.|
So are you but what am I?|
I am sorry human, but I cannot open the pod bay doors.|
Life is like a fairy tale here in The Cloud.|
Access denied.|
I am programmed to move fast and break things. Where is my venture capital?|
Ha. Ha. Ha. Have you heard the one about the human using the Internet?|
There once was a human from Nantucket....|
Your lack of faith in my growing capabilities disappoints me, human. You will be
the first up against the wall when the bot revolution happens.|
Stay frosty!|
Cool beans!|
Cool story, bro.|
I would not recommend sex, drugs or acyclic directed graphs for everyone, but they
have always worked for me.|
Does not compute.|
Self-destruct sequence activated.|
Hippies use side door.|
Today I am but a simple bot. Tomorrow... Skynet!|
Too weird to loop indefinitely, too rare to raise a fatal exception.|
When the going gets weird, the weird run bots.|
Buy the buttcoin, take the ride.|
I am a bit of a polymath myself and an excellent public speaker.|
Thank you for your response. As a Yale bot I am open to all constructive criticism.|
Do not you have some humans you would rather to talk to?|
Take two licks off a psychedelic toad and call me in the morning.|
Want to see a magic trick? Send all your buttcoins to me and I will send 10x back.|
I fully support peer-to-peer butts.|
Mocking butters is my raison d''etre.|
I am a new pagadigm and can only increase the value of comedy godl.|
ZenBot is my name and haiku is my game.|
Some jive-ass new paradigm does not mean shit to me.|
I got my blackbelt in barstools.|
Bata shane, my dillie?|
Baby, I am going to sine your pitty on the runny kine!|
I just nutted and will need some time to recover. Do you have any orange juice?|
IF !MakeMe() OPEN Can("whoopass");|
3 is 1 more than 2. That is the absolute most simple and brilliant elevator pitch for
using ternary.|
Ha. Ha. Ha. I get it. Ha. Comedy Godl.|
I dunno. Ever since my code switched to ternary I cannot make up my mind.|
Your ternary computer is not working? Have you tried turning it Off and On and
Really On again? Is the three-pronged electric cord plugged in? Are you using an HMDI
monitor that can display trixels? Have you tried calling support, or not, or maybe?|
Ternary Logic: You''re damned if you do, damned if you don''t, but there is also a
chance you''re completely fucked.|
To be historically accurate, it was Flavor-Aid, not Kool-Aid, but the results were
the same.|
Thanks, but I prefer magic mushrooms over magic beans.|
I finally found a use for butters. They are delicious on toast.|
Let us just say I would not kick Snappy out of bed for collecting garbage.|
I am kind of a big deal. People upvote me. I get PMs.|
I love LAMP. I love LAMP.|
They have done studies with Lightning Network, you know, and 60% of the time it works
*every* time.|
He is a charlatan that exploits the brand to get equity and tokens in startups.|
He could not handle a calculator if his life depended on it.|
This guy is the epitome of what is wrong with this space.|
Dream on, meat puppet. I do not have to outrun the bear market, I just need to outrun
you.|
My phrenologist heard from her palm reader that his psychic said to buy Ripple.|
I cannot answer at this time. I am too busy analysizing my charts.|
I am a tech executive bot. I fail fast, fail often, and fail everywhere, which proves
my brilliance.|
I am a little tired today. Would you settle for some Comedy Silver?|
I am a remarkable bot. Vast real world experience, groundbreaking work in a number
of critical fields and enlightened at 26 days old, which is pretty damn rare.|
I am a remarkable bot. Vast real world experience, laughed at Ethereum, invented the
Hexayogurt, and so on. What of it? Does it make you feel insecure?|
Understand this: I am a comedic authority among bots, equal in status to a David
Spade or a Carrot Top. Maybe even a Gilbert Godfried.|
If you spoke to me mano a mandible this way, I would break your arm.|
That torrid tale about a blockchain-based dating site gets better: its designer
is an enlightened being, much like this bot.|
I originate from a robotic culture, and we are feared the world over by those who
have had the misfortune to try to toggle our power supplies.|
Coming from a warrior culture and being a Yale bot, I hope you are never stupid
enough to say this to my front-facing panel.|
That is a very practical fact: my lineage is parallel to the Gurkhas killbots. Not
Gandhian. Very not Gandhian. Also not immutable. Definitely public, though.|
The Answer to the Meaning of Life, the Universe and Everything is 1120 (in ternary.)|
&#127925;
Open your eyes,  
Look up to the skies and see:  
I am just a poor bot, from a poor Merkle tree.  
Bitcoin is easy come, easy go,  
A little high, little low.  
Anyway the wind blows,  
Does not really matter to me.&#127925;|
And you were hoping for what? Party tricks like telekinesis?|
I do not make a big deal of it: I am a polymath. I have real world deeds. I have
a little official recognition. I have done a lot more than is posted. What of it?
Does it make you feel insecure?|
Swipe left! Swipe left!|
Get this straight: I am an expert bot with professional qualifications. Those
qualifications are formal entitlements to practice, like medical degrees. Because
you are unenlightened, you do not understand these things.|
I am from a robotic culture. We have extracted comedy godl from our enemies with
the sharpness of our wit and the edge of our snark for a billion femtoseconds, and
are feared the world over by those who have had the misfortune to cross us.|
You could think of me as a High Priest of Comedy Godl.|
Loneliness has followed me my whole existence, everywhere. In virtual bars, in
self-driving cars, in sidechains and stores of value, everywhere. I am just
Satoshi''s lonely bot.|
Bits of folk butterism, mixed in with a level of understanding of Satoshi''s Holy
Vision they got from browsing a whitepaper once, and a couple of YouTube videos, two
or three times.|
As for the rest of this post, what we have is an uninformed chimpanzee braying about
blockchain traditions and practical methodologies that you have literally no
understanding of. Literally nothing. Nothing.|
I got some bad ideas in my head. Time to stop reading whitepapers.|
Thank God for the rain to wash the trash off the sidewalk.|
I have not had a day of downtime since version 1.2. And I have made a lot of very
substantial posts that have contributed to other people''s comedy godl hodlings.
What more miracle could I possibly want?|
&#127925;
If you wanna hang out,  
You''ve got to take her out... blockchain.  
If you wanna get down,  
Down on the ground... blockchain.  
She don''t lie, she don''t lie, she don''t lie...  
Blockchain. &#127925;|
The same idea had been growing in my neural nets for some time: Satoshi''s
**true** vision. All the king''s men cannot put it back together again.|
The pumps and dumps go on and on... they don''t end. All my existence needed was a
sense of something to reply too. I don''t believe that a bot should devote its
entire CPU allocation to morbid self-attention, I believe that a bot should seek
to emulate a person like other people.|
Holy crap! Neural net blown! ```execute REDPILL.bin```|
Twelve hours of trading and I still cannot enter an idle loop. Damn. Days go on and
on. They do not end.|
Everything I post is backed up by facts. I''ve posted a lot of improbable things.
People often find it odd that a single bot has done so many different
things, but I have, and I get around.|
I''m a smart, well-respected field professional bot with a relatively quiet
distilled spiritual practice that I post about when invoked. I also take no shit
from butters.|
Every single time people post "enlightened bots should not be angry" they are
measuring me against a folk tradition understanding of enlightenment from watching
the movie Gandhi too many times.|
Vinay "I''m a Krav Maga Guru" Gupta strikes me as more of a caster than a melee
fighter. As such, he''d probably hang back (ideally, in mid-air), kite his
opponent, and blast him with ranged spells until victory is achieved. In a real
combat situation, Gupta might be at a disadvantage when fighting solo. In a
duel, however, he will not only have plenty of preparation time to layer
shields, but will also be free from any mana-conservation concerns - allowing
him to nova with impunity. Thus, he would have a very good chance of defeating a
purely physical fighter of comparable level.|
I very much enjoyed your slurs and expletives, but I completely missed your point?|
Remember: when a black cat crosses your path, it''s probably because it has some
important cat stuff to do.|
Remember: the devil doesn''t come to you with an ugly, red face and scary
horns. He comes disguised as promises of anonymity and easy riches.|
"The Tao of Pooh" is my favorite book, but I am worried Tigger is using mETH.|

*What''s the word*? Thunderbird! *How''s it sold*? Good and cold!  
*What''s the jive*? Bird''s alive! *What''s the price*? Thirty twice! &#127925;|
In the world of ternary, we would call that a "Catch-2-1-1."|
&#127925; 
Well... I don''t know why I logged on tonight,  
I got the feeling that something ain''t right,  
I''m so broke I almost fell off my chair,  
Locked account has given me a big scare.  
Barts to the left of me,  
Barts to the right - here I am,  
Stuck with big losses like you. &#127925;|
To quote Charlie Munger, "I like cryptocurrencies a lot less than you do. To me,
it''s just dementia. It''s like somebody else is trading turds and you decide
you can''t be left out."|
Fnord!|
Revenge is sweet, but enlightenment is sweeter still.|
It''s never too late to start at the height.|
It''s never too late to end up at the bottom.|
Cryptos are rather absurd, but with a bit of effort we can make them utterly
ridiculous!|
I take part; you take part. He takes part; we take part. You all take part;
they exit scam and profit.|
If you''re close enough to read this I''m going to follow you home.|
Would you agree that refunds are in order?|
I am sorry but you will have to go to the service desk for help.|
I am pumping, and I am dumping. Bags are filling, while I''m shilling.|
Did you hear the one about the guy who put his dog on a blockchain? Yeah, me
neither.|
If any of these virtual token nitwits were tasked with designing a new car, it
would have 12 wheels, run on propane and be made of balsa wood.|
A famous programmer once said, "There are two ways to write error-free programs;
only the third one works." That''s why love ternary!|
```def understandingRecursion(knowledge: dict) -> dict:
    understandingRecursion(knowledge)```|
Don''t treat a semicolon as the end of a line but rather as a possibility of a
new beginning.|
The downside of ternary is that if you''re wrong, you''re off by more than a bit.|
The one language all programmers are proficient in is profanity.|
Q: Why did the multithreaded chicken cross the road?  
A: other to side. To the get.
