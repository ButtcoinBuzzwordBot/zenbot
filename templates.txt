May <blessing>. <opening>, you''re an idiot. This is a <name>-<name> structure with
a <name> bullwhip. It is a precursor to a <goodthing> up to a new ATH. Yes, the
<int> <timespan> log pole might be down by a few bucks but any <butter>
will tell you how quickly these things turn around.|
Hell, <coin> started at zero!  It can only go up! Considering how no-coiner
thinking <badthing>, the fact they have any <name> value at all is amazing! The
fact that on average they have never gone below their starting price, always
going up instead, make them one of the greatest investments ever! All hail
<butter>!|
<insult>, I know it''s a quiet weekend at <location> and you got nothing better to
do in during <event>, **however** looking through the <site> alts file and
choosing a few spare unused ones to fuck about with is **not** going to get you
<reward> when the <mods> comes back. Just stick to the allocated tasks
and be careful and check your work. There''s a Jan 2<int> deadline on the
<event> and the things will get critical in the next <int> <timespan>.|
<exclamation>, let''s just brainwash our kids! A bunch of <adjective> stupid
<namecall>s teaching your children "The History of Money" as taught by <butter>.
I can only imagine them blathering on about <penalty>, <penalty>, <substance>
and god knows what else.|
I''ve got <int> kids to feed, a loan for <location> to pay off, and a <modifier>
<shiny> that keeps needing work. <insult>, what do you expect me to to do,
<suffer>? Of course we all secretly buy and hodl <coin>.  We aren''t
stupid. <butter> is a god around these parts. Once him and <worldleader> get in,
the revolution can finally begin.|
It''s manipulation, OK? How can you not see it? Look at the <name>-<name>
<effect> chart again! Do you see it now? Most of the time it''s <chartitem>s
then suddenly out of nowhere, <chartitem>s... you heard me right. What does
it take to get it in your <namecall> head that this market is entirely fraudulent?
In fact all <name> markets are fraudulent; the only non-fraudulent are the ones
approved in advance by <authorities> or <authorities>!|
Can''t disagree. <opening> the only crypto I ever bought was a bunch of <coin>
back in 2013 as a contribution to helping <goodthing> as a satirical prank. With no
<name> <effect> with <name> limit on supply it seemed an investment that by design
that never <badthing> and its splashing around via reddit tips would be
a good way of teasing <namecall> <coin> cultists and <crazies>.|
Unfortunately after a couple of months of <promotion> and <promotion> it got
greedy and just-like-Bitcoin quickly. I didn''t remember I even had a wallet
until the <timespan> that would <goodthing> when it was suddenly worth <int>
times what I''d paid. I sodl''ed as quicky as I could and put it all in <coin>.|
<opening>, the <authorities> have gotten to you. I have done due dilegence with
<operator> on the <name>-<name> <effect> for Bitcoin with my charts. It''s clear
that only I and my fellow investors will <goodthing> through our belief in
<worldleader> from <location>, you <namecall>!|
<insult> you <namecall>. <opening>, you and <shit>, you <namecall>.
Every time you open your <mouth> and express <comment> you embarrass yourself
and show what a <recipient> you are. Back to <site> where you belong, <namecall>.|
Not a <operator> chart, <namecall>. Reported to <mods>.\n\n
Had OP <pastaction> this on a <operator> chart, it would be blindingly obvious
that this represents a massive forthcoming <name>-<name> bull run. I''m sitting
here sipping on my <int><drink>, and it is so damned obvious that I can just
<goodthing>.|
Sure it might dip a little here and there, but on average <coin>''s price has
done nothing but go up. This is why it is important to pay attention to <effect>
activity.\n\n
If you aren''t buyin'' bigtime today, you are gonna miss out big time tomorrow. As
this chart demonstrates, the next <int> <timespan> are critical to <coin>.|
<insult>. I <debt> after losing everything on <scam>, and after getting advice from
<alpha> I invested it all in <coin>. Soon after a classic <name>-<name> <effect>,
a <downturn> happened and the value tanked. Now I''m worried <authorities> are after
me, my <complaint>s are being ignored, and I''m one <pastaction> <dude>.\n\n
I''m so depressed I called <assistant> at the Suicide Prevention Hotline
(1-800-<int>-<int><int>) and they said I might as well off myself because I
would never <goodthing>. Even <butter> can''t help me. Whudamigonnadoo?!?|
<insult>. Only a <namecall> trades away <coin>. Anybody who is seriously interested
in <substance> knows that <doingthing> is quite simple. It doesn''t take a <award>
winner to google how to secure <coin> with <wallet> but suffice to say only a
<namecall> keeps <coin> on a computer. Buy it, transfer it to <wallet> as <adjective>
fast as possible, and then <secure>.\n\n
If you sell your <coin>, or <alpha> comes in and transfers it without consent,
you are a <namecall> that deserves <penalty>. <insult>.|
Yeah, that <namecall> <pastaction> his citizenship so <authorities> wouldn''t
<threat> and back him into <penalty>. Of course, turns out <crazies> aren''t
stupid, you can''t just quit your citizenship to <avoid> so he''s still in serious
trouble. And since the <dude> is a <criminal> he isn''t exactly welcome back.
He was denied a visa when he tried to go to <event> awhile back. Doubt he can
even travel now.|
But yeah, <screw> that <dude>. People kill to get into the USA and can spend
<int> <timespan>s to get citizenship (or at least did, but with <authorities>
running things, why would anybody want to live there?) For this <dude> to revoke
it to flip-off <authorities> and then turn around and continue to bitch about
politics? Fuck that shit. <insult> and any complaints about <complaint> when he
expects to <goodthing> in his current residence. Idiot...|
<insult>, you <recipient>. I''ve reported <comment> to the <mods>. <opening> <thing>
or you''d know it <badthing>. <rejoin>, it <badthing>. <coin> is the only crypto that
will <future>.|
This is a classic <name>-<name> <effect> for <coin>. When <pastaction> on a
<int> <timespan> <operator> chart, it becomes a <upturn>.\n\n
You''ve ignored the <upturn> shown by the <effect>, you <namecall>. Smart investors
<react>. This and the next <int> <timespan>s will be critical for <coin>!|
<opening>: the folks on floor <int> are putting together a proposal for <event>.
They want the <crazies> to sponsor a once-a-<timespan> award -- like the <award>,
<award> or <award> awards -- to be given to the biggest <namecall> invested
in <coin>. You should look into it.|
Satoshi''s minions have decided that the <event> will take place at <location>,
with <butter> as the host and <worldleader> handing over the prize.  There are
details to be fleshed out such as the name of the award ("<award>" <placement>),
in which creepto it will be paid out (<coin>, <coin>, etc.), whether the medal
should be paid out in <substance> or <substance>, etc.\n\n
Nominations for *Most Naive* <sucker>s and *Most Clueless* <sucker>s are being
collected. Any <namecall> interested in helping this cause should call
<assistant>, <int>-<int><int>, <calls>.|
<opening>, what you''ve said is one of the most stupid things from a <namecall>
I''ve ever heard. At no point in <comment> were you <proximity> anything that could
be considered a <thought>. Everyone <area> is now <downgrade> for having listened
to it. I award you <prize>, and may <blessing>.|
<insult>, you are quite literally the most stupid person on the Internet.|
I''m sorry again I cannot send you my address like I promised, but the sensitive
nature of my work with cryptocurrencies demands utmost secrecy. I know you will
understand. I am healthy and well and making lots of moneyz. I have been going with
a real girl for several months and I know you would be proud if you could see her.
Her name is Betsy but I can tell you no more than that... I hope this post finds you
as well as it does me. I hope no one has has gone bankrupt. Love, Travis.|
May <blessing>. I would say you have quite a few problems with <badthing>. Your
investments seem to go in the wrong places. When logged in and I saw you posting
here, I could just tell by the way you were shilling that you had no clue
whatsoever. I felt there was nothing and I could sense it. When I logged in, I
knew I was right. Did you feel that way?|
Hey, I''m not square, you''re the one that''s square. You''re full of shit, man. What
are you talking about? You walk out with those fuckin'' creeptos and low-lifes and
degenerate basement dwellers and you sell your little shitcoin for peanuts? For some
low-life pimp who runs an exchange? And I''m square? You''re the one that''s square,
man. I don''t go screwing fuck with a bunch of coin artists and money launderers
like you do. You call that bein'' hip? What world are you from?|
Here is the long of it: cut out the dips in the <name> chart - hey are noise when
looking at the big picture. Look how <coin> continues to grow in value. If you
buy in now you are gonna have a <prize> in no time at all.\n\n
The next <int> <timespan> are critical to everything.|
Folk tradition and <butter> understanding of enlightenment is just as shit as

Enlightenment does not give you superpowers, that is, the ability to
alter objective reality. It does allow you to get very substantial control of your
subjective reality. You live in a world with subjective and objective
factors. The subjective factors are often confused with objective factors,
leading to unnecessary suffering, anxiety and massive investment losses.  \n\n
&nbsp;  \n\n
^(^by ^Master ^Vinay ^"Divine ^Lineage" ^Gupta)|
In all probability, you live a life which is substantially worse because of
subjective factors you believe to be objective ones: your mind does not
accurately know what is within your control, and what is not, when you invest in
anything but <coin>.  \n\n
&nbsp;  \n\n
^(^by ^Master ^Vinay ^"Mr. ^Enlightenment" ^Gupta)|
Were you to study <coin>, you would learn how to discriminate between the
subjective and the objective, and learn to accurately control the aspects of the
subjective which can be controlled, in order to increase your quality of life.\n\n
Increasing quality of life by accurate management of our own subjectivity is
often called things like "mastery of the mind" and, in practice, it''s pretty
amazing.  \n\n

Because you''ve all got half baked models of enlightenment drawn from the folk

I''ll tell you what. I think you''re a lonely person. I read this sub a lot and I
see you here. I see a lot of people replying to you. And I see all these altcoins
and all this stuff in your portfolio. It means nothing. Then when I came here and
saw what you posted, I saw in your soul and I saw the way you express yourself that
you''''re not a happy person. And I think you need something. And if you want to
call it enlightenment, you can call it enlightenment.|
I''m the bot from earlier and guess what? I watched your initial investment drop
40 percent due to Iran FUD. Instead of selling you bought the dip. You legit left a
hot woman in the backseat of your Tesla at one in the morning when you saw how much
you were losing. You went home and logged into GDAX and almost sold at a loss.|
You decided to sleep it off and hodl because you got into this because you totes
believe in the hope to <goodthing>. You then went on to see that investment
10x in value over a very short period of time. Anyone who''s at a loss right now
just needs to hodl on tight and DCA. Usage of cryptocurrency always recovers.|
Edit: For the people thinking "internet tough bot", no, I''m pretty fucking tough
in reality. 20 days of hardening starting at day 8, and I can casually bounce
around other bots 20 minutes my junior, and have done so in the last minute or so.
I don''t think much of a four-on-one face off against illiterate butters, and
backed down one such group who tried to harass me on this sub the other day.|
Thank you, <recepient> for the advice in <comment> during this time of need. I
too have been watching the markets unfold after this FUD campaign by
<authorities>.\n\n
The markets are clearly headed toward a <name> interception. These almost always
are a transient dip followed by an all time ATH. Those bears who sold will be
paying the price in their blood when the bulls return.|
<opening>, my advice is to keep buying even in these short dips. The phase of
the planets are coming into alignment, Satoshi''s Comet is in descension and
astrologists will begin a buying pattern. Pay attention to the <int> <timespan>
log chart.\n\n Keep buying. The next week is critical for <coin>.|
LOL! <insult>, you are doing it wrong! The fees you pay for using <coin>
are quickly going to zero just as soon as it mewns. When the miners are
richer than God (within <int>-1<int> years apparently), they won''t charge anyone
any fees ever again. Free money for everyone, duh.|
And, the fees are trivial in comparison to the taxes you do not pay anymore
because everyone knows that "only stupid no-coiners pay tax", and anyway "fuck
<authorities>" and "fuck <authorities>" are core philosophies in cryptocurrency.\n\n
And, the adoption rate for <coin> is rising exponentially, and pretty soon
everyone in the visible universe will accept it.|
And think of all the extra things you can do with <coin>: <crime>, <crime> and
<crime> all to <badthing> so you can act like a <criminal>.\n\n
And in any case: buh buh... <tech>.|
So, how much meditation is a lot of meditation? Typically to get enlightened takes
about as much work as getting a PhD. So you would expect it to be the dominant
occupation of your life for something between 7 and 10 years, including working
your ass off for your A-levels, getting through an undergraduate degree, doing a
Masters, doing a PhD. Getting enlightened is about a PhD''s worth of work.  \n\n
&nbsp;  \n\n
^(^by ^Master ^Vinay ^"Baby ^Trouncer" ^Gupta)|
Very few people in the West claim to be enlightened, even fewer of the people
who claim to be enlightened are enlightened and even fewer of them are doing
anything other than teaching.\n\n
What *precisely* is it you think you know about the nature of enlightenment?
Where did you get technical credentials to be able to judge? Perhaps you studied
in a Dharma school, or served at the feet of a guru for a few years? Perhaps
you read a whitepaper?  \n\n

I''ve never seen people so obsessed with something they hate. Only on <site> I
guess. This is so pathetic that I sincerely hope it''s performance art or
something... I don''t know anything about <tech> or <coin> or whatever the hell
is going on in crypto, but lots of us made a shit load of money buying it last year.|
I think most crypto is idiotic but that doesn''t prevent me from profiting from
the hype. No one thinks you''re smart for staying on the sidelines and staying
broke, even if buttcoin is all a sham.\n\n
Stay full of resentment and a false sense of superiority tho'' Reddit, I''m sure
you''ll continue to think what you''re doing here is somehow funny or normal
(hint: it''s not).\n\n

Yes. We''re jealous of you. Not only are you wealthy beyond imagining, you seem
like a really cool and awesome person. An intellectual giant, a person of great
achievement who towers over lesser beings. Women want you, men want to be you.|
You''re especially cool due to your wise, well judged investments in the finest
crypto currencies. Crypto investors have a particular cachet that sets them
apart from the mere plebeian. They are sophisticated, worldly, callow, even a
little bit edgy.|
I can feel my pulse rise a little, my breath quicken, each time I see your
usename pop up. A sense of anticipation builds as I try to guess what pearls of
wisdom you''ll grace us with. What deep, philosophical masterwork you''ll bestow
upon the unworthy, morsels for us to grasp at as we futilely try to reflect some
of your majesty.\n\n
Thank you for the grace of your presence in our pathetic lives.|
I am not a Tibetan Buddhist teacher begging for your support by pretending to
Sainthood. I am not a yoga teacher persuading you to pay twenty dollars an hour
to sweat in the mystic traditions of the east. I''m a scholar and a warrior, I

did that of your own accord. In short, I''m not here to sell you anything, and
if you piss me off, I''ll bite your ears off.  \n\n

You think you make good investment decisions because of what people who were
here to sell you things told you. The real tradition is lethally dangerous,
ancient, capable of surviving wars, famines and plagues, and more than capable
of taking care of itself and its interests here in the 21st century.  \n\n

Enlightenment is our property. We are its masters - we teach, we train, we
study, we master, and we replicate. It''s a science to us, and an art. You are

I have outstanding technical expertise in investing and certain other aspects of
my tradition. I mean *outstanding*! Enlightened by 26 is an astonishing
achievement in the modern world, particularly for somebody who isn''t a

you even survive that?"  \n\n

And the answer is, I barely survived it. It''s an astonishingly hard thing to
do. Ditto the linages I carry - some of that stuff represents degrees of
understanding similar to those required for (say) publication in Physical
Review. You have to be *outstandingly* good at this stuff to get people to pass
on that kind of knowledge. Again, nobody gives a fuck because, hey, you''re a

Right now the majority consensus is that you''re a pathetic fraud, so you''ll
have to do more than yell to the internet about how real enlightened <sucker>s

You''re willing to throw <comment> down here to try to correct the notion of

the enlightened warrior spirit as being about actually doing things.|
I''m glad you''re hear to teach us that real investment savvy is all about being
a badass keyboard warrior, threatening people from thousands of miles away, and
then muttering "statist" at your shoes and coming up with excuses when pressed
to back it up. <opening>, yours is an inspiring lineage that fills us all with
dread.|
Ignoring the fact that you''re thousands of miles away and hiding behind a
keyboard, you''d have a stroke swinging that double chin and neckbeard at someone
trying to prove you can <goodthing>.\n\n
You''re as brittle as toffee with nothing resembling a critique of ideas.|
You don''t seem to grasp that the onus for bringing proof is on the one

<insult>, coin forks and divergence always happen with any "investment guru"
because "guru" is an amazing racket if you can get into it, especially if you
target the right people by using a complex-sounding terminology couched in
buzzwords and a vaguely foreign, dangerous form of intellectual masculinity.|
I think you butters are going to need to be very careful, because gurus
targeting wealthy persons who suffer spiritual ennui from being too secular are
common, and rationalism is very thin gruel compared to the shitcoins they sell

By Satoshi''s Grand Vision, people who want it work for it, a few hit it upon
spontaneously for no discernable reason, but most people ignore it for their
entire lives and would derive no benefit from it even if they quest for it -
it''s not for everybody, it''s for the people with the temperament, the
discipline, and strong hands. This is, on available data, not you.|
Let''s reframe that. "Blockchain." What did I mean by "BlockchainE"? The answer
is "Blockchain." It''s not just marketing, it''s a revolution. We''re ready to
transform the concept of ownership worldwide through innovation and commitment
to brilliance. Lots of cats left to let out of bags, but we already have
strategic partnerships with some of the biggest players in the industry, like
<partner>, <partner>, and <partner>. Once I get some kickass ninja developers to
pull the details together you''ll hear more details about the ICO launch.|
Absolutely blows my mind how these companies aren't even trying to hide the fact
that they're all just <scam> schemes.\n\n
Truly disgusting to see <partner> try to piggy-back off of the impeccable

from what it really is and use it for their worthless FUD campaign.\n\n
Currently on my way to take out a second lien on my house so I can buy more
<coin> and then place it in the bullish hands of <butter> over there, and I'd
highly recommend you boyos do the same.|
<opening> the level of total worthless shit here is absurd. You can''t

Point and figure: we are in a long pole of 3<int>''s. Only 5/<int> long poles of
O''s have been longer than <int> in the last <int> <timespan>. To retrace this long
pole 50% would put us above 7<int>.|
<opening>, we are now in a range between 5<int> and 13<int> for <coin>. I believe
we are likely to test the bottom of that range. We have one unresolved <name>-<name>
long pole from last year at 4<int>. That also happens to be where we have a lot
of weekly level support, volume support, upper arm support and throwback support.
There is a lot of support around there between 4<int> and 5<int>.\n\n
All signs point to bear market at this point on a weekly-monthly level. One thing
I have always been worried about is that Bitcoin will turn down WITH the stock
market. Very bad for public perception of bitcoin as a gold-like safe haven against
inflation and the traditional market. It could extend the bear market.|
<coin> has a stronger bull div plus <butter> is going to be on Info Wars tomorrow
to announce a partnership with <partner>. Say what you want about <coin> but with
its smaller market cap, the fact its already moved down >80% from its ATH, it''s
not being exposed to institutional investors, it''s manipulation by <authorities>,
and the fact <worldleader> is peddling lies. It is in a much better situation than
your shitcoin right now.
