[opening]
For starters
As anyone with a clue would see
It''s clear to anyone who''s not a moron
If you had a clue you''d see
At first glance
At the slightest glance
Any idiot can see
It''s obvious
Mentally handicapped monkeys can see
It''s painfully obvious
No duh
Please girlfriend
Duh homie
Obviously
Don''t you have a clue
Don''t be an idiot
Look, you simpleton
It''s clear you''re stupid
Listen you mewling bitch
Hear this
Lend an ear
Listen up, buttmonkey
Open your ears you sod
Borrow a brain dude

[thing]
this thing you call a chart is not a log chart
this thing you call a chart is not a horseshoe chart
your TA is akin to MS Paint scribbles
this chart is not a exponential
this chart doesn''t have candles
this MS Paint graph is not a chart
the chart mixed up the X and Y axis
your senseless post is useless
your uninformed opinion shows nothing
your uneducated claim makes you look like a fool
this bullshit shows your simplistic idiocy
you are a beta submitting to statist thugs

Add to that
To add insult to injury
And add this to the list
Anyone with a brain can see
The other thing you should have noticed

keeps the working class down
keeps slavery alive for wagecucks
keeps people on welfare
masks the clear advantages of crypto
masks the advantages of liquidity
masks the economic gains from freedom
