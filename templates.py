["Things have hit "peak 
mainstream" as far as I'm concerned. Can't get more peak than
a former camera company
selling
cloud block miners,
tea companies
starting
"block chain projects" and 
hooters franchises 
announcing
"something with the blockchain".

I honestly think this is [coin]'s last mainstream hurrah. It publicly sold
out and abandoned any premise to be a digital currency useable by [criminal]s.
Not only that but it proved the blockchain cannot scale. At it's core, Bitcoin is deeply, unfixably flawed and "the blockchain" is a datastructure, not a business model or a solution to a problem.

Now, the whole crypto mess could turn into some kind of amway underground MLM goldbug thing. But aside from being a public laughing stock.... the goose is cooked. Bitcoin is dead (or at least will be shortly)
